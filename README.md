:wave: Hey! I'm a Software Egineer working [@exidioco](https://github.com/exidioco) trying *NOT* to break too many things in one go. I primarily work on Go, Terraform, Ansible, Containers and Container Orchestration, CI/CD Pipelines and a bunch of cloud Services. I've also worked on frontend and backend services in the past, primarily on ReactJS and PostgreSQL.

## Goals For 2021
*Even though 2020 has a potential to be the worst year of all time, i'm trying to be optimistic.*
