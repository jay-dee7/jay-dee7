:wave: Hey! I'm a Software Engineer working primarily on Go, Svelte, Terraform, Ansible, Containers and Container Orchestration, Container Registeries, CI/CD Pipelines and a bunch of cloud Services. I've also worked on frontend and backend services in the past, primarily on ReactJS and PostgreSQL.

I'm super excited for all things eBPF, the Linux Kernel, projects like Firecracker and many more.
